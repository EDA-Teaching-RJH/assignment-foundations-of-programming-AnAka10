# Assignment 1

**Constraint:** 
You cannot use Dictionaries or Classes (Not yet covered). You must use **Parallel Lists**. You are not permitted to use AI tools to auto-generate code.

## Scenario

You are a new Ensign in the Operations Division. The ship's "Personnel Management System" was written by a developer who has been transferred off the ship for incompetence. The code is a disaster: it is one giant block of over 100 lines, uses global variables incorrectly, contains infinite loops, and crashes constantly.

Your orders are to **refactor the entire codebase** into a modular, function-based system and expand its capabilities to manage the entire crew.

## Part A: The "Spaghetti Code" Disaster (20 Marks)

**Context:** The following code is provided to you. It is a single, massive script with no structure.

**Task:**

1. Open this code space () I have populated it with this spaghetti code.
    
2.  Debug the **Syntax Errors** (missing colons, broken strings).
    
3.  Debug the **Logical Errors** (Infinite loops, list index out of range, type errors).
    
4.  **Do not fix the structure yet.** Just get this specific block of code to run without crashing, then save it as `old_system.py`.
    
5.  Document **10 distinct bugs** you found, **you will need this for part C**.

**Each Fix is worth 2 Marks for a maximum of 20 Marks** 

**Hints**

You will want to research the functionality of ``.pop()`` and ``.index()``

## Part B: The Modular Architecture (40 Marks)

**Context:** You must create a **NEW** file called `fleet_manager.py`. You cannot use the old code structure. You must build a robust system using **Parallel Lists** to track 4 data points per crew member: `Names`, `Ranks`, `Divisions`, and `IDs`.

**Requirements:** You must attempt to implement **ALL 10** of the following functions. Each function must be called correctly from a central `main()` loop. Each function is worth **(4 Marks Each) with a maximum of 40 Marks**

Incomplete = **0 Marks**
Partial Implementation = **2 Marks** 
Full Implementation = **4 Marks**

**Hints** 

 - [ ] Some of the definitions will use multiple variables not just one
       to run, for example ```add_member()``` takes names, ranks, divs
       and ids.        

 


```
🔴🔴🔴 YOU MUST COMMIT EVERYTIME YOU ADD A FEATURE  🔴🔴🔴
```

1.  `init_database()`: Returns 4 lists pre-populated with at least 5 Star Trek characters and their data.
    
2.  `display_menu()`: Queries users full name, Prints the options and current student logged in and returns the user's choice.
    
3.  `add_member(names, ranks, divs, ids)`:
    
    -   Validates ID is unique.
        
    -   Validates Rank is a valid TNG rank.
        
    -   Appends data to all 4 lists.
        
4.  `remove_member(names, ranks, divs, ids)`:
    
    -   Asks for an ID.
        
    -   Finds the index.
        
    -   Removes the entry from _all 4 lists_ to keep them in sync.
        
5.  `update_rank(names, ranks, ids)`:
    
    -   Finds a member by ID.
        
    -   Updates their rank string.
        
6.  `display_roster(names, ranks, divs, ids)`:
    
    -   Iterates through the lists using `range(len(names))`.
        
    -   Prints a formatted table of all crew.
        
7.  `search_crew(names, ranks, divs, ids)`:
    
    -   Asks for a search term.
        
    -   Prints any crew member whose name contains that term.
        
8.  `filter_by_division(names, divs)`:
    
    -   Asks user for "Command", "Operations", or "Sciences".
        
    -   Prints only members in that division using `match` or `if` .
        
9.  `calculate_payroll(ranks)`:
    
    -   Iterates through the ranks list.
        
    -   Assigns a credit value to ranks (e.g., Captain = 1000, Ensign = 200).
        
    -   Returns the total cost of the crew.
        
10.  `count_officers(ranks)`:
    
	   -   Counts how many "Captain" and "Commander" ranks exist and returns the integer.

## Part C: The Development Report (25 Marks)

**Length:** 1 Page.

1.  **Legacy Code Post-Mortem:** A breakdown of the 10 bugs found in Part A. You must explain _why_ the bug occurred (e.g., "The code `if x = 1` causes a Syntax Error because `=` is assignment, whereas `==` is comparison" ). **(20 Marks)  2 per bug**
    
2.  **Parallel List Strategy:** Explain the dangers of using parallel lists. What happens if you remove a name from the `names` list but forget to remove the ID from the `ids` list? How did your code prevent this, or how could it be prevented? **(5 Marks)**
Incomplete = **0 Marks**
Partial Implementation = **3 Marks** 
Full Implementation = **5 Marks**



## Part D: Technical Demonstration (15 Marks)

**Length:** 3-5 Minutes.

1.  **Refactor Demo:** Show the `old_system.py` crashing, then show your fixed version of it from Part A running. **(5 Marks)** 
Incomplete = **0 Marks**
Partial Implementation = **3 Marks** 
Full Implementation = **5 Marks**


    
3.  **System Tour:** Walk through your new `fleet_manager.py`. **(10 Marks)** Incomplete = **0 Marks**
Partial Implementation = **5 Marks** 
Full Implementation = **10 Marks**
